* Example code
To get you started with some examples, I have made some quick and dirty ones here. Most should be loadable with ease. For =texture.frag= you need to load your own texture in the Scheme code. Example usage is found in example Scheme code.


Shaders:
- =texture.frag=: Simple shader that loads a texture and moves it around the screen.
- =raymarch.frag=: Simple raymarcher fragment shader.
- =hearts.frag=: Heart patterns with some "noise"/"randomness" put in. 
- =plasma.frag=: Plasma using the classical sum of sines (and cos) technique.


Scheme code:
- =myscheme.scm=: Some sample Scheme code I have used with the examples. 



Thanks to [[https://iquilezles.org/articles/][Inigo Quillez]] obviously! Like anyone who codes shaders, I owe a lot to him. His guides on distance functions, palettes etc. are amazing. Thought he deserved a special mention since I use some of his functions in my shaders here :)
